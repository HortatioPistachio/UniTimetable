                <h2>Welcome to the UoA Timetable converter</h2>
                <p>This web app takes your Uni timetable and puts it into either  a google calendar or an iCal. During the process, 
                  the only data collected is the timetable that gets shared with you. All passwords are entered into the University's system.
                  You can check this by looking at the URL, if it ends with "adelaide.edu.au" the university owns it. The code is open source
                   and more can be found in the <a href="/about">about tab</a>

                  If you want an iCal calendar you can put in whatever email you want. The email is only used to tell which timetable is yours.
