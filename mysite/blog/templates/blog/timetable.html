                <h2>Welcome to the UofA Timetable converter</h2>
                <p>This web app takes your Uni timetable and puts it into a google calendar. During the process, 
                  the only data collected is the timetable that gets shared with you. All passwords are entered into the University's system.
                  You can check this by looking at the URL, if it ends with "adelaide.edu.au" the university owns it. The code is open source
                   and more can be found in the <a href="/about">about tab</a>
