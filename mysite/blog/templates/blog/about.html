                <h2>How the timetable converter works</h2>
                
                <p>
                  Firstly, we need to get the data used by the timetable app. Because of how the university set up the timetable app,
                   this was a little tricky. I plan on making it so that all you need is your university ID and password however I’m not 
                   confident in being able to keep the password safe. Step 1 logs you into the university’s timetable app. 
                
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second step is a link to the data the timetable app uses. It cannot be accessed before logging in and will not redirect you 
                  to a log in page.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, the data is in JSON format which makes parsing it super easy. Once parsed, the important bits of the data such as the class 
                  location are put into a python dictionary. Using the google calendar API, a new calendar is made, classes added and then shared with you.
                </p>
